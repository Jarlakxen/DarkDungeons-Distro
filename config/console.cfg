# $Id$
#
#

#
# Purpose:
# Configures command characters that activate scripts when typed on the POL console.
#
# Structure:
# Commands
# {
#   [CMD  (letter)  (script) [(description}]]
#   [CMD...]
# }
#
# Explanation:
# 'letter' is case sensative, so 'a' can run a different script than 'A'. And '^A' is activated with CTRL-A
# 'script' must be placed in /scripts/console.
# '?' is the help command - it prints the descriptions of all the other console commands.
# The number keys (0-9) are reserved for the shutdown scripts (after a certain delay)
# '^C' (CTRL-C) is reserved for immediate core shutdown.
# There are three special command script names: [lock] locks the console,
# no further console commands may be entered. [unlock] unlocks the console from the locked state,
# and [lock/unlock] toggles the lock status of the console.
# Reloadable with ReloadConfiguration() (polsys.em) or SIGHUP under linux
#
