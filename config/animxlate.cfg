# Purpose:
# Defines the mappings for animation codes for standing and while on horseback.
#
# Structure:
# OnMount
# {
#   [(int normal animation) (int mounted animation)]
# }
#
# Notes:
# Will probably be used to specify translations for creatures, so they
# don't do illegal things and turn invisible.
