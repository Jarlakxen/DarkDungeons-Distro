Welcome to the Distro To-Do! This list is by no means definitive, so if you see anything that should be on here, even if it is very small, let me know.


Please read through this list and contact tekproxy(at)gmail.com if you find anything that you would like to do. You will also need to read StyleGuide.txt in the distro docs directory and write your code according to those standards. DO NOT assume that you are not good enough to contribute. ;) We all have to start somewhere.

We're trying to make the Distro like current OSI but not at the cost of modularity and configurability. If it can be 90% OSI, and highly configurable and mostly self-contained, that is wonderful.




MAIN STUFF
----------------
NPC definitions - unassigned
  This may be easy to do with greasemonkey scripts on firefox using the stratics website. Need to look more into this.


Spawn Locations - unassigned
  If you know OSI spawn locations well, or run a shard with some already set up in your own custom format, we can use the help.


Boats and Housing - unassigned
  This is almost completely unscripted. The brunt of the work could be done by converting 095 scripts.
  * Boats -- Support exists for using the planks. The listener engine is created to control boats.
  * Nothing really done for housing (multis)

Crafting - Assigned to MuadDib
  Nearly finished. But needs some more help, as Dib's undie time is limited.


Guilds - Assigned to MontuZ
  Finished and in testing.


Spawning - unassigned
  Austin said "almost complete". It doesn't have a web interface.


Merchants - unassigned
  Can copy over most of the stuff in 095 and get it to work with BrainAI. Merchants should be finished and usable, just not configured.
  Not sure if merchants do training of if there is AI scripted for that...

Guards - unassigned
  It could be missing the criminal in the look around system, or a gone criminal event or it's not scripted at all.


Arenas - unassigned
  Basic framework is there, but otherwise unscripted.
  Can use an older existing system (upgraded for new gumps) by Austin?



BUGS
----------------
Script Path & Name - Description
NONE KNOWN


SKILLS
----------------
Some of these skills depend on other systems that are either unfinished or do not exist, but some would be easy. Don't be shy. ;) Any other skills not listed should be considered finished and in testing.

 - magery - Assigned to tekproxy
    pet AI must be scripted for summons
    function documentation

 - cooking - Assigned to Ninde

 - detect hidden - unassigned

 - fishing - unassigned

 - forensic evaluation - unassigned

 - herding - unassigned

 - inscription - unassigned

 - item identification - unassigned

 - lockpicking - unassigned

 - musicianship - unassigned

 - poisoning - unassigned

 - remove trap - unassigned

 - tailoring
     Requires testing.

 - taming - unassigned
    Will require pets to be added to BrainAI.

 - taste identification - Assigned to tekproxy
    Mostly finished. Slight changes should be made to kegs.

 - tinkering - unassigned

 - tracking - unassigned

 - veterinary - unassigned

 - focus
     Requires testing.

 - AOS/LBR/UOR skills & systems are not top priority but should be added in future versions.

 - Tailoring rewrite with new crafting still. Need to update for new hide/cloth handling like
   smithing and bowcraft.

 - Tailoring needs to use 0x1766 base cloth types only (inside tailor script check this).

 - Add Combine Cloth reserved container to Tailoring. Changes cloth types to base 0x1766

 - Finish Scissors system in Tailoring for new style crafting.


ASSIGNED
----------------
Can't think of anything right now...




UNASSIGNED
----------------
Stat advancement has been enabled, but needs testing

LockLevel cprop defined for every lockable item. LockLevels would go from 1 to 10. Not sure what objects had more difficult locks.
  Lockpicking and magic unlock both require some sort of lock level.

Some steps have been made to move some numbers out of attributes code into config files to make tweaking gain speeds and difficulties easier.
  Still need to do a lot more looking into this....

Limit number of accounts per IP
  This may be easy to do in the accounts package, but might not be important enough to be added for a whlie.

Speech commands
  Could be a script that's started on a player onlogon that registers speech events and processes things like "I must consider my sins."

Make pre-AOS spell resistance a configurable option for magery.

Blue, red, white and orange potion scripts should make use of the strength cprop in :alchemy:itemdesc.cfg (look at greenPotion.src for an example)

Item category/type cprop for itemdesc entries such as "potion" for potions and "food" for foods. This would be used by other scripts such as tasteID to determine if an item is a potion or not instead of a list of objtype numbers.

Some old distro code that does not meet distro style standards, including $Id: distro-todo.txt 1294 2008-09-09 23:28:33Z AustinHeilman $ tags at the top of files, and should be fixed but are not a high priority as there are more important things to do. A good solution would be a script that automates the process.





SMALL STUFF
----------------
Find a better place for CONSTs in drinkPotion.inc - Assigned to tekproxy

Keg script should be cleaned up and made to account for tasteidentification - Assigned to tekproxy

Tailoring gump bugs - Assigned to Ninde

When Target() is called, is there a max range? Would it be possible for someone to do a last target macro 50 screens away and do something?
