title The Arrow and the Song
author Longfellow
p1l1 I shot an arrow into
p1l2 the air,
p1l3 It fell to earth,
p1l4 I knew not where;
p1l5 For, so swiftly it
p1l6 flew, the sight
p1l7 Could not follow in
p2l1 its flight. I breathed
p2l2 a song into the air,
p2l3 It fell to earth, I
p2l4 knew not where;
p2l5 For who has sight so
p2l6 keen and strong,
p2l7 That it can follow the
p2l8 flight of song?
p3l1 Long, long afterward,
p3l2 in an oak
p3l3 I found the arrow,
p3l4 still unbroke;
p3l5 And the song, from
p3l6 beginning to end,
p3l7 I found again in the
p3l8 heart of a friend.

p2l1 The smith, a mighty
p2l2 man is he,
p2l3 With large and
p2l4 sinewy hands;
p3l1 And the muscles of
p3l2 his brawny arms
p3l3 Are strong as
p3l4 iron bands.
p4l1 His hair is crisp,
p4l2 and black, and long,
p4l3 His face is like
p4l4 the tan;
p5l1 His brow is wet with
p5l2 honest sweat,
p5l3 He earns what e'er
p5l4 he can,
p6l1 And looks the whole
p6l2 world in the face,
p6l3 For he owes
p6l4 not any man.
p7l1 Week in, week out,
p7l2 from morn till night,
p7l3 You can hear his
p7l4 bellows blow;
p8l1 You can hear him
p8l2 swing his heavy
p8l3 sledge, With
p8l4 measured beat
p8l5 and slow,
p9l1 Like a sexton ringing
p9l2 the village bell,
p9l3 When the evening
p9l4 sun is low.
p10l1 And children comming
p10l2 home from school
p10l3 Look in at the
p10l4 open door;
p11l1 They love to see
p11l2 the flaming forge,
p11l3 And hear the
p11l4 bellows roar,
p12l1 And catch the burning
p12l2 sparks the fly
p12l3 Like chaff from a

p1l5 honest man, not a
p1l6 trickster.
p2l1 Nevertheless, the
p2l2 experience of our
p2l3 times shows that the
p2l4 princes who have done
p2l5 great things are the
p2l6 ones who have taken
p2l7 little account of
p2l8 their promises and
p3l1 who have known how
p3l2 to addle the brains
p3l3 of men with craft.
p4l1 In the end they have
p4l2 conquered those who
p4l3 have put their
p4l4 reliance on

title The Voice of Reason
author Ayn Rand
p1l1 If the good, the
p1l2 virtuous, the morally
p1l3 ideal is suffering
p1l4 and self-sacrifice --
p1l5 then, by that standard,
p1l6 capitalism had to
p1l7 be damned as evil.
p2l1 Capitalism does not
p2l2 tell men to suffer,
p2l3 but to pursue enjoyment
p2l4 and achievement, here,
p2l5 on Earth -- capitalism
p2l6 does not tell men to
p2l7 serve and sacrifice,
p2l8 but to produce and
p3l1 profit...and above all,
p3l2 capitalism does not
p3l3 permist anyone to
p3l4 expect or demand, to
p3l5 give or to take
p3l6 the unearned.

title Talking to Wisps
author Yorick of Moonglow
p1l1 This volume was
p1l2 sponsored by
p1l3 donations from Lord
p1l4 Blackthorn, ever a
p1l5 supporter of
p1l6 understanding the
p1l7 other sentient races
p2l1 of Britannia.
p2l2 Wisps are the most
p2l3 intelligent of the
p2l4 nonhuman races
p2l5 inhabiting Britannia.
p2l6 'Tis claimed by the
p2l7 great sages that
p2l8 someday we shall be
p3l1 able to converse with
p3l2 them openly in our
p3l3 native
p3l4 tongue--indeed, we
p3l5 must hope that wisps
p3l6 learn our language,
p3l7 for it is not possible
p3l8 for humans to
p4l1 pronounce wispish!
p4l2 The wispish
p4l3 language seems to
p4l4 only contain one
p4l5 vowel, the letter Y.
p4l6 However, the letters
p4l7 W, C, M, and L seem
p4l8 to be treated
p5l1 grammatically as
p5l2 vowels, and in
p5l3 addition every letter
p5l4 is followed by what
p5l5 sounds to the human
p5l6 ear like a glottal stop
p5l7 It is possible that the
p5l8 glottal stop is
p6l1 considered a vowel
p6l2 as well.
p6l3 Wisps do make use
p6l4 of what sound to us
p6l5 like pitch and
p6l6 emphasis shifts
p6l7 similar to
p6l8 exclamations and
p7l1 questions. The average
p7l2 word in wispish seems
p7l3 to consist of three
p7l4 phonemes and three
p7l5 glottal stops, plus
p7l6 possibly a pitch shift.
p7l7 It often sounds like a
p8l1 fire burning or
p8l2 crackling. Some have
p8l3 speculated that what
p8l4 we are analyzing is
p8l5 in fact nothing more
p8l6 than the very air
p8l7 crackling near the
p8l8 wisp's glow, and not
p9l1 language, but this is
p9l2 of course unlikely...

title A Grammar of Orcish
author Yorick of Yew
p1l1 This volume, and
p1l2 others in the series,
p1l3 are sponsored by
p1l4 donations from Lord
p1l5 Blachthrone, always a
p1l6 supporter of
p1l7 understanding the
p2l1 other sentient races
p2l2 of Britannia -
p2l3 The Orcish tongue
p2l4 may fall unpleasingly
p2l5 'pon the ear, yet it
p2l6 has within it a
p2l7 complex grammar oft
p3l1 misunderstood by
p3l2 those who merely
p3l3 hear the few broken
p3l4 words of English our
p3l5 orcish brothers
p3l6 manage without
p3l7 education.
p3l8 These are the basic
p4l1 rules of orcish:
p4l2 Orcish has five
p4l3 tenses: present, past,
p4l4 future imperfect,
p4l5 present interjectional,
p4l6 and prehensile.
p4l7 Examples: gugroflu,
p4l8 gugrofloog, gugrobo,
p5l1 gugroglu!, gugrogug.
p5l2 All transitive verbs
p5l3 in the prehensile
p5l4 tense end in ug.
p5l5 Examples:
p5l6 urgleighug,
p5l7 biggugdaghgug,
p5l8 curdakalmug.
p6l1 All present
p6l2 interjectional
p6l3 conjugations start
p6l4 with the letter G
p6l5 unless the contain the
p6l6 third declensive
p6l7 accent of the letter U.
p6l8 Examples:
p7l1 ghothudunglug, but not
p7l2 azhbuugub.
p7l3 The past tense can
p7l4 only refer to events
p7l5 since the last meal,
p7l6 but the prehensile
p7l7 tense can refer to
p7l8 any event within
p8l1 reach.
p8l2 The present tense
p8l3 is conjugated like the
p8l4 future imperfect
p8l5 tense, when the
p8l6 interrogative mode is
p8l7 used by pitching the
p8l8 sound a quarter-tone
p9l1 higher.
p9l2 Orcish hath no
p9l3 concept of person, as
p9l4 in first person, third
p9l5 person, I, we, etc.
p9l6 Orcish grammar
p9l7 relies upon the three
p9l8 cardinal rules of
p10l1 accretion, prefixing,
p10l2 and agglutination, in
p10l3 addition to pitch. In
p10l4 the former, phonemes
p10l5 combine into larger
p10l6 words which may
p10l7 contain full phrasal
p10l8 significance
p11l1 In the second,
p11l2 prefixing specific
p11l3 phonetic sounds
p11l4 changes the subject of
p11l5 the sentence into
p11l6 object, interrogative,
p11l7 addressed individual,
p11l8 or dinner.
p12l1 Agglutination occurs
p12l2 whenever four of the
p12l3 same letter are
p12l4 present in a word, in
p12l5 which case, any two
p12l6 of them may be
p12l7 removed or slurred.
p12l8 Pitch changes the
p13l1 phoneme value of
p13l2 individual syllables,
p13l3 thus completely
p13l4 altering what a word
p13l5 may mean. The
p13l6 classic example is
p13l7 Aktgluthugrot
p13l8 bigglogubuu
p14l1 dargilgaglug lublublub
p14l2 which can mean You
p14l3 are such a pretty
p14l4 girl, My mother ate
p14l5 your primroses, or
p14l6 Jellyfish nose paints
p14l7 alms potato,
p14l8 depending on pitch.
p15l1 Orcish poetry often
p15l2 relies upon repeating
p15l3 the same phrase in
p15l4 multiple pitches, even
p15l5 changing pitch
p15l6 midword. None of
p15l7 this great art is
p15l8 translatable.
p16l1 The orcish language
p16l2 uses the following
p16l3 vowels: ab, ad, ag, akt
p16l4 at, augh, auh, azh, e,
p16l5 i, o, oo, u, uu. The
p16l6 vowel sound a is not
p16l7 recognized as a vowel
p16l8 and does not exist in
p17l1 their alphabet.
p17l2 The orcish alphabet is
p17l3 best learned using the
p17l4 classic rhyme
p17l5 repeated at 23
p17l6 different pitches:
p17l7 Lugnog ghu blat
p17l8 suggaroglug,
p18l1 Gaghbuu dakdar ab
p18l2 highugbo,
p18l3 Gothnogbuim ad
p18l4 gilgubbugbuilug
p18l5 Bilgeaugh thurggulg.
p18l6 Translation of the
p19l1 first pitch:
p19l2 Eat food, the first
p19l3 letter is ab,
p19l4 Kill people, next
p19l5 letter is ad,
p19l6 I forget the rest
p19l7 But augh is in there
p19l8 somewhere!
p20l1 What follows is a
p20l2 complete phonetic
p20l3 library of the orcish
p20l4 language:
p20l5 ab, ad, ag, akt, alm,
p20l6 at, augh, auh, azh,
p20l7 ba, ba, bag, bar, baz,
p20l8 bid, bilge, bo, 
p21l1 bog, bog, brui, bu,
p21l2 buad, bug, bug, buil,

title A politic call to anarchy
author Lord Blackthorne
p1l1 Let it never be said
p1l2 that I have aught as
p1l3 quarrel with my liege
p1l4 Lord British, for
p1l5 indeed we be of the
p1l6 best of friends,
p1l7 sharing amicable
p1l8 games of chess 'pon
p2l1 winter's night and
p2l2 talking at length into
p2l3 the wee hours of the
p2l4 issues that affect the
p2l5 realm of Britannia.
p2l6 Yet true friendship
p2l7 doth not prevent true
p2l8 philosophical
p3l1 disagreement either.
p3l2 While I view with
p3l3 approval my lord's
p3l4 affection for his
p3l5 carefully crafted
p3l6 philosophy of the
p3l7 Eight Virtues,
p3l8 wherein moral
p4l1 behavior is
p4l2 encouraged in the
p4l3 populace, I view
p4l4 with less approval the
p4l5 expenditure of public
p4l6 funds upon the
p4l7 construction of
p4l8 shrines to said
p5l1 ideals. The issue is
p5l2 not one of funds
p5l3 however, but a
p5l4 disagreement most
p5l5 intellectual over
p5l6 the proper way of
p5l7 humankind in an
p5l8 ethical sense. Surely
p6l1 freedom of decision
p6l2 must be regarded as
p6l3 paramount in any
p6l4 such moral decision?
p6l5 Though none fail to
p6l6 censure the
p6l7 murderer, a subtler
p6l8 question arises when
p7l1 we ask if his behavior
p7l2 would be ethical if he
p7l3 were forced to it.
p7l4 I say to thee, the
p7l5 reader, quite flatly,
p7l6 that no ethical system
p7l7 shall have sway over me
p7l8 unless it convinceth me
p8l1 for that freely made
p8l2 choice is to me
p8l3 the sigh that the
p8l4 system has validity.
p8l5 Whereas the system of
p8l6 Virtues that my liege
p8l7 espouses is indeed a
p8l8 compilation
p9l1 of commonly approved
p9l2 virtues, I approve of
p9l3 it. Where it seeks to
p9l4 control the populace
p9l5 and restrict their
p9l6 diversity and their
p9l7 range of behaviors, I
p9l8 quarrel with it. And
p10l1 thus do I issue this
p10l2 politic call to
p10l3 anarchy, whilst humbly
p10l4 begging forgivness of
p10l5 Lord British for my
p10l6 impertinence:,
p10l7 Celebrate thy
p10l8 differences. Take thy
p11l1 actions according to
p11l2 they own lights.
p11l3 Question from what
p11l4 source a law, a rule,
p11l5 a judge and a virtue
p11l6 may arise. 'Twere
p11l7 possible (though I
p11l8 suggest it not
p12l1 seriously) that a
p12l2 daemon planted the
p12l3 seed of these Virtues
p12l4 in my Lord British's
p12l5 mind; 'twere possible
p12l6 that the Shrines were
p12l7 but a plan to destroy
p12l8 this world. Thou canst
p13l1 not know unless thou
p13l2 questioneth, doubteth,
p13l3 and in the end, unless
p13l4 thou relyest upon
p13l5 THYSELF and they
p13l6 judgement. I offer
p13l7 these words as mere
p13l8 philosophical musings
p14l1 for those who seek
p14l2 enlightenment, for
p14l3 'tis the issue that
p14l4 hath occupied mine
p14l5 interest and that of
p14l6 Lord British for some
p14l7 time now.

title Virtues
author Lord British
p1l1 Within this world live
p1l2 people with many
p1l3 different ideals and
p1l4 this is good. Yet what
p1l5 is it within the people
p1l6 of our land that sorts
p1l7 out the good from the
p1l8 evil, the cherished
p2l1 from the disdained?
p2l2 Virtue, I say it is,
p2l3 and virtue is the
p2l4 logical outcome of a
p2l5 people who wish to
p2l6 live together in a
p2l7 bonded society.
p3l1 For without Virtues
p3l2 as a code of conduct
p3l3 which people maintain
p3l4 in their relations with
p3l5 each other, the fabric
p3l6 of that society will
p3l7 become weakened. For
p3l8 a society to grow and
p4l1 prosper for all, each
p4l2 must grant the others
p4l3 a common base of
p4l4 consideration.
p4l5 I call this base the
p4l6 Virtues. For though
p4l7 one person might gain
p5l8 personal advantage by
p5l1 breaching such a code,
p5l2 the society as a whole
p5l3 would suffer.
p5l4 There are three
p5l5 Principle Virtues that
p5l6 should guide people to
p5l7 enlightenment. These
p5l8 are: Truth, Love and
p6l1 Courage. From all the
p6l2 infinite reasons one
p6l3 may have to found an
p6l4 action, such as greed
p6l5 or charity, envy or
p6l6 pity, the three
p6l7 Principle Virtues
p6l8 stand out.
p7l1 In fact all other
p7l2 virtues and vices can
p7l3 be shown to be built
p7l4 from these principles
p7l5 and their opposite
p7l6 corruption's of
p7l7 Falsehood, Hatred and
p7l8 Cowardice. These
p8l1 three Principles can
p8l2 be combined in eight
p8l3 ways, which I will
p8l4 call the eight virtues.
p8l5 The eight virtues
p8l6 which we should
p8l7 build our society upon
p8l8 follow.
p9l1 Truth alone becomes
p9l2 Honesty, for without
p9l3 honesty between our
p9l4 people, how can we
p9l5 build the trust which
p9l6 is needed to maximize
p9l7 our successes.
p9l8 Love alone becomes
p10l1 compassion, for at
p10l2 some time or another
p10l3 all of us will need the
p10l4 compassion of others,
p10l5 and most likely
p10l6 compassion will be
p10l7 shown to those who
p10l8 have shown it.
p11l1 Courage alone
p11l2 becomes Valor,
p11l3 without valor our
p11l4 people will never
p11l5 reach into the
p11l6 unknown or to the
p11l7 risky and will never
p11l8 achieve.
p12l1 Truth tempered by
p12l2 Love gives us Justice,
p12l3 for only in loving
p12l4 search for the truth
p12l5 can one dispense fair
p12l6 Justice, rather than
p12l7 create a cold and
p12l8 callous people.
p13l1 Love and Courage
p13l2 gives us Sacrifice,
p13l3 for a people who love
p13l4 each other will be
p13l5 willing to make
p13l6 personal sacrifices to
p13l7 help others in need,
p14l8 which one day, may be
p14l1 needed in return.
p14l2 Courage and Truth
p14l3 give us Honor, great
p14l4 knights know this
p14l5 well, that chivalric
p14l6 honor can be found by
p14l7 adhering to this code
p14l8 of conduct.
p15l1 Combining Truth,
p15l2 Love and Courage
p15l3 suggest the virtue of
p15l4 Spirituality the virtue
p15l5 that causes one to be
p15l6 introspective, to
p15l7 wonder about ones
p15l8 place in this world and
p16l1 whether one's deeds
p16l2 will be recorded as a
p16l3 gift to the world or a
p16l4 plague.
p16l5 The final Virtue is
p16l6 more complicated. For
p16l7 the eighth combination
p16l8 is that devoid of
p17l1 Truth, Love or Courage
p17l2 which can only exist
p17l3 in a state of great
p17l4 Pride, which of
p17l5 course is not a virtue
p17l6 at all. Perhaps this
p17l7 trick of fate is a test
p17l8 to see if one can
p18l1 realize that the true
p18l2 virtue is that of
p18l3 Humility. I feel that
p18l4 the people of Magincia
p18l5 fail to see this to such
p18l6 a degree that I would
p18l7 not be surprised if
p18l8 some ill fate awaited
p19l1 their future.
p19l2 Thus from the
p19l3 infinite possibilities
p19l4 which spawned the
p19l5 Three Principles of
p19l6 Truth, Love and
p19l7 Courage, come the
p19l8 Eight Virtues of
p20l1 Honesty, Compassion,
p20l2 Valor, Justice,
p20l3 Sacrifice, Honor,
p20l4 Spirituality and
p20l5 Humility.

title On the diversity of our land
author Lord Blackthorne
p1l1 While I deplore the
p1l2 depredations of the
p1l3 misguided and
p1l4 belligerent races
p1l5 with which we
p1l6 share our fair
p1l7 Britannia and
p1l8 alongside the populace
p2l1 do mourn the needless
p2l2 deaths that their
p2l3 raids cause, I cannot
p2l4 countenance the policy
p2l5 of wholesale
p2l6 slaughter of these
p2l7 races that seems to be
p2l8 the habity of our
p3l1 soldierly element. Can
p3l2 we not regard the
p3l3 ratmen, lizard men,
p3l4 and orcs are fellow
p3l5 intelligent beings
p3l6 with whom we share a
p3l7 planet? Why must we
p3l8 slay them on sight,
p4l1 rather than attempt to
p4l2 engage them in
p4l3 dialogue? There is no
p4l4 policy of shooting at
p4l5 wisps when they
p4l6 grace us with their
p4l7 presence (not that an
p4l8 arrow could do much
p5l1 to pierce them!).
p5l2 To view these
p5l3 creatures as vermin
p5l4 denies their obvious
p5l5 intelligence and we
p5l6 cannot underestimate
p5l7 the repercussions that
p5l8 their slaughter may
p6l1 have. If we regard the
p6l2 slaying of fellow
p6l3 humans as a crime, so
p6l4 must we regard the
p6l5 killing of an orc.
p6l6 At the same time,
p6l7 should a lizardman
p6l8 slay a human, whould
p7l1 we not forgive their
p7l2 ignorance and
p7l3 foolishness? Let us
p7l4 not surrender the
p7l5 high moral ground by
p7l6 descending to
p7l7 bestiality.
p8l8 Now, I say not that
p8l1 we should fail to
p8l2 defend ourselves in
p8l3 case of attack, for
p8l4 even amongst humans
p8l5 we see war, we see
p8l6 famine and we see
p8l7 assault (though we
p8l8 owe a debt of
p9l1 gratitude to our Lord
p9l2 British for preserving
p9l3 us from the worst of
p9l4 these!). However,
p9l5 incursions such as the
p9l6 recent tragedy which
p9l7 cost us the life of
p9l8 Japheth, Guildmaster
p10l1 of Trinsic's Paladins,
p10l2 are folly.
p10l3 I had met Japheth,
p10l4 and like all paladins,
p10l5 he burned with an
p10l6 inner fire. Yet though
p10l7 I had the utmost
p10l8 respect for him, none
p11l1 could deny the hatred
p11l2 that flashed in his
p11l3 eyes the mere mention
p11l4 of orcs. And thus he
p11l5 carried his battle to
p11l6 the orc camps and
p11l7 died there, unable to
p11l8 rise above his own
p12l1 childhood experiences
p12l2 depicted in his book,
p12l3 The Burning of
p12l4 Trinsic. 'Tis a shame
p12l5 that even our
p12l6 mightiest men fall
p12l7 prey to this ignorance!
p12l8 Are there not
p13l1 legends of orcs
p13l2 adopting human
p13l3 children to raise as
p13l4 their own? Tales of
p13l5 complex societies built
p13l6 underground by races
p13l7 we regard as bestial?,
p13l8 Let us not repeat the
p14l1 mistake of Japheth of
p14l2 the Paladins and let
p14l3 us cease to persecute
p14l4 the nonhuman races,
p14l5 before we discover
p14l6 that we are harming
p14l7 ourselves in the
p14l8 process.

title Classic tales of Vesper: Volume 1
author Clarke's Printery
p1l1 'Tis an Honor to
p1l2 present to Thee these
p1l3 Tales collected from
p1l4 Ages Past. In this
p1l5 Inaugural Volume, we
p1l6 present this Verse oft
p1l7 Recited as a Lullabye
p1l8 for sleepy Children.
p2l1 Preface by Guilhem
p2l2 the Scholar,
p2l3 The meaning of this
p2l4 verse has oft been
p2l5 discussed in halls of
p2l6 scholarly sorts, for
p2l7 its mysterious
p2l8 singsongy melody is
p3l1 oddly disturbing to
p3l2 adult ears, though
p3l3 children seem to find
p3l4 it restful as they
p3l5 sleep. Perhaps it is
p3l6 but the remnant of a
p3l7 longer ballad once
p3l8 extant, for there are
p4l1 internal indications
p4l2 that it once told a
p4l3 longer story about
p4l4 ill-fated lovers and
p4l5 a magical experiment
p4l6 gone awry. However,
p4l7 poetic license and the
p4l8 folk process has
p5l1 distorted the words
p5l2 until now the locale
p5l3 of? the tale is no
p5l4 more than in the wind,
p5l5 which while it serves
p5l6 a pleasingly
p5l7 metaphorical purpose,
p5l8 fails to inform the
p6l1 listener as to any real
p6l2 locale!
p6l3 Another possibility
p6l4 is that this is some
p6l5 form of creation myth
p6l6 explaining the genesis
p6l7 of the various
p6l8 humanoid creatures
p7l1 that roam the lands
p7l2 of? Britannia. It does
p7l3 not take a stretch of
p7l4 the imagination to
p7l5 name the middle
p7l6 verse's girl becomes a
p7l7 tree as a possible
p7l8 explanation for the
p8l1 reaper, for in the
p8l2 area surrounding Minoc,
p8l3 reapers are oft
p8l4 referred to among the
p8l5 lumber jacking
p8l6 community as
p8l7 widowmakers. That
p8l8 these creatures are of
p9l1 arcane origin is
p9l2 assumed, but the
p9l3 verse seems to imply a
p9l4 long ago creator and
p9l5 uses the antique
p9l6 magickal terminology
p9l7 of plaiting strands of
p9l8 ether that is so often
p10l1 found in ancient
p10l2 texts. In addition,
p10l3 the reference to
p10l4 snakehills may
p10l5 profitably be regarded
p10l6 as a reference to an
p10l7 actual location, such
p10l8 as perhaps a local
p11l1 term for the Serpent's
p11l2 Spine.
p11l3 A commoner
p11l4 interpretation is that
p11l5 like many nursery
p11l6 rhymes, it is a simple
p11l7 explanation for death,
p11l8 wherein the wind
p12l1 snatches up boys and
p12l2 girls and when they
p12l3 sleep in order to keep
p12l4 the balance of the
p12l5 world. Notable tales
p12l6 have been written for
p12l7 children of
p12l8 adventures in the
p13l1 Snakehills, which
p13l2 are presumed to be an
p13l3 Afterworld whence
p13l4 the spirit lives on. A
p13l5 grim lullabye, to be
p13l6 sure, but no worse
p13l7 than lest I die
p13l8 before I wake surely.
p14l1 In either case, 'tis
p14l2 an old favorite herein
p14l3 printed for the first

title Dimensional travel: A Monograph
author Dryus Doost
p1l1 'Tis beyond the
p1l2 scope of this small
p1l3 monograph to discuss
p1l4 the details of
p1l5 moongates and the
p1l6 manners in which
p1l7 they distort the
p1l8 fabric of reality in
p2l1 such a manner as to
p2l2 permit the passage of
p2l3 living flesh from place
p2l4 to place, world to
p2l5 world, or indeed from
p2l6 dimension to
p2l7 dimension.
p2l8 Instead, allow me to
p3l1 bring thy attention,
p3l2 Gentle Reader, to the
p3l3 curious
p3l4 characteristics that
p3l5 are shared by certain
p3l6 individuals within our
p3l7 realm.
p3l8 Long has it been
p4l1 known that the blue
p4l2 moongate permits
p4l3 travel from place to
p4l4 place and none have
p4l5 trouble in taking this
p4l6 path. Yet 'tis also
p4l7 known, albeit only to a
p4l8 few, that certain
p5l1 individuals are unable
p5l2 to traverse the black
p5l3 moongates that permit
p5l4 travel from one
p5l5 dimension to another.
p5l6 The noted mage and
p5l7 peer of our realm,
p5l8 Lord Blackthorn, once
p6l1 told me in conversation
p6l2 that his arcane
p6l3 research had indicated
p6l4 that the issue was one
p6l5 of conservation of
p6l6 ether. To wit, given
p6l7 the postulate that
p6l8 matter within a given
p7l1 dimension may be but
p7l2 a cros-section of
p7l3 ethereal matter that
p7l4 exists in multiple
p7l5 dimensions, it
p7l6 becomes obvious that
p7l7 said ethereal
p7l8 structure cannot enter
p8l1 dimensions in which
p8l2 it is already present.
p8l3 Imagine an
p8l4 individual (and the
p8l5 Lord Blackthorn
p8l6 hinted that he was one
p8l7 such) who exist
p8l8 already in some form
p9l1 in multiple
p9l2 dimensions: said
p9l3 individual would not
p9l4 be able to cross into
p9l5 another dimension
p9l6 because HE IS
p9l7 ALREADY THERE.
p9l8 The implications of
p10l1 this are staggering,
p10l2 and merit further
p10l3 study. 'Tis well
p10l4 known by theorists in
p10l5 the field that
p10l6 divisions in the
p10l7 ethereal structure of
p10l8 an individual are
p11l1 already implicit at
p11l2 the temporal level, as
p11l3 causality forces
p11l4 divisions upon the
p11l5 ether. This is the
p11l6 basic operating
p11l7 mechanism by which
p11l8 white moongates
p12l1 function, permitting
p12l2 time travel.
p12l3 As time travel is not
p12l4 barred by the
p12l5 presence of an earlier
p12l6 self (though
p12l7 encountering said
p12l8 earlier self can prove
p13l1 arcanely perilous),
p13l2 there must be some
p13l3 rigidity to the
p13l4 ethereal structure that
p13l5 bars multiple
p13l6 instantiations
p13l7 of structures from
p13l8 manifesting within
p14l1 the same context.
p14l2 If one regards time
p14l3 and causal bifurcation
p14l4 as a web, perhaps the
p14l5 appropriate analogy
p14l6 for dimensional
p14l7 matrices is that of a
p14l8 crystalline structure
p15l1 with rigid linkages.
p15l2 The only way in
p15l3 which an individual
p15l4 such as Lord
p15l5 Blackthorn, who
p15l6 exists in multiple
p15l7 dimensional matrices,
p15l8 can cross worlds via a
p16l1 black moongate, would
p16l2 be for the entire
p16l3 crystalline structure
p16l4 of the dimension to
p16l5 perfectly match the
p16l6 ethereal resonance of
p16l7 the destination
p16l8 dimension.
p17l1 The problem of
p17l2 why certain
p17l3 individuals are
p17l4 already replicated in
p17l5 multiple crystalline

title Treatise on alchemy
author Felicia Heirophant
p1l1 The alchemical arts
p1l2 are notable for their
p1l3 deceptive simplicity.
p1l4 'Tis true that to our
p1l5 best knowledge
p1l6 currently, there are
p1l7 but eight valid potions
p1l8 that can be made
p2l1 (though I emphasize
p2l2 that new discoveries
p2l3 may always await).
p2l4 However, the delicate
p2l5 balance of confecting
p2l6 the potions is
p2l7 difficult indeed and
p2l8 requires great skill.
p3l1 To give thee an
p3l2 example of the
p3l3 simpler potions that
p3l4 can be created by
p3l5 those well-versed in
p3l6 the subtleties of
p3l7 alchemy.
p3l8 Black pearl, that
p4l1 rare substance that is
p4l2 oft found lying
p4l3 unannounced upon the
p4l4 surface of the ground,
p4l5 when properly
p4l6 crushed with mortar
p4l7 and pestle, can yield
p4l8 a fine powder. Said
p5l1 powder in the proper
p5l2 proportions when
p5l3 mixed via the
p5l4 alchemical arts can
p5l5 yield a wonderfully
p5l6 refreshing drink.
p5l7 The revolting blood
p5l8 moss so gingerly
p6l1 scraped off
p6l2 windowsills by
p6l3 fastidious housewives
p6l4 is but a tiny cousin to
p6l5 the wilder version,
p6l6 which when properly
p6l7 prepared yields a
p6l8 magical liquid that for
p7l1 a time can make the
p7l2 imbiber a more agile
p7l3 and dextrous
p7l4 individual.
p7l5 However, beware of
p7l6 the deadly nightshade,
p7l7 for it yields a
p7l8 deceptively
p8l1 sweet-tasting poison
p8l2 that can prove highly
p8l3 fatal to the drinker,
p8l4 and in fact is also
p8l5 used by assassins to
p8l6 coat their blades.
p8l7 Fortunately, this
p8l8 latter art of poisoning
p9l1 is little known!
p9l2 There is much to
p9l3 reward the student of
p9l4 alchemy, indeed. The
p9l5 rumors of longtime
p9l6 alchemists losing
p9l7 their hair and
p9l8 acquiring an
p10l1 unhealthy pallor, not
p10l2 to mention unsightly
p10l3 blotches upon their
p10l4 once-fair skin, are
p10l5 unhappily, true. Yet
p10l6 the joys of the mind
p10l7 make up for the
p10l8 complete loss of
p11l1 interest that others
p11l2 may have in thee as an
p11l3 object of courtship,
p11l4 and I have never
p11l5 regretted that choice.
p11l6 Honestly, truly. Not
p11l7 once.

title Talking to wisps
author Heigel of Moonglow
p1l1 This volume was
p1l2 sponsored by
p1l3 donations from Lord
p1l4 Blackthorn, ever a
p1l5 supporter of
p1l6 understanding the
p1l7 other sentient races of
p1l8 Britannia.
p2l1 Wisps are the most
p2l2 intelligent of the
p2l3 nonhuman races
p2l4 inhabiting Britannia.
p2l5 'Tis claimed by the
p2l6 great sages that
p2l7 someday we shall be
p2l8 able to converse with
p3l1 them openly in our
p3l2 native tongue --
p3l3 indeed, we must hope
p3l4 that wisps learn our
p3l5 language, for it is not
p3l6 possible for humans
p3l7 to pronounce wispish!
p3l8 The wispish
p4l1 language seems to only
p4l2 contain one vowel, the
p4l3 letter Y. However, the
p4l4 letters W, C, M and L
p4l5 seem to be treated
p4l6 grammatically as
p4l7 vowels and in addition
p4l8 every letter is
p5l1 followed by what
p5l2 sounds to the human
p5l3 ear like a glottal stop.
p5l4 It is possible that the
p5l5 glottal stop is
p5l6 considered a vowel as
p5l7 well.
p5l8 Wisps do make use
p6l1 of what sounds to us
p6l2 like pitch and
p6l3 emphasis shifts
p6l4 similar to
p6l5 exclamations and
p6l6 questions.
p6l7 The average word in
p6l8 wispish seems to
p7l1 consist of three
p7l2 phonemes and three
p7l3 glottal stops, plus
p7l4 possibly a pitch shift.
p7l5 It often sounds
p7l6 burning or crackling.
p7l7 Some have speculated
p7l8 that what we are
p8l1 analyzing is in fact
p8l2 nothing more than the
p8l3 very air crackling
p8l4 near the wisp's glow,
p8l5 and not language, but
p8l6 this is of course
p8l7 unlikely.

title Britannian flora: A casual guide
author Herbert the Lost
p1l1 Oft 'pon rambling
p1l2 through the woods
p1l3 avoiding bears have I
p1l4 spotted some plant
p1l5 whose like I have
p1l6 never seen before and
p1l7 concluding that I was
p1l8 a blithering idiot for
p2l1 failing to notice it
p2l2 in the past. Equally
p2l3 as oft have I
p2l4 concluded
p2l5 that I was a worse
p2l6 idiot for not running
p2l7 faster from the bear.
p2l8 While not all my
p3l1 readers may share
p3l2 my proclivites for
p3l3 tree-climbing, it
p3l4 occurred to me that
p3l5 mayhap mine
p3l6 information might
p3l7 serve some humble
p3l8 purpose.
p4l1 The two most
p4l2 unique flower plants
p4l3 in the Britannian
p4l4 countryside are the
p4l5 orfleur and the
p4l6 whiteflower, also
p4l7 called white horns.
p4l8 The orfleur is
p5l1 notable for its massive
p5l2 orange-red blossoms,
p5l3 which dwarf
p5l4 marigolds like the sun
p5l5 dwarfs you (sic)
p5l6 common fireball spell.
p5l7 The odor of said
p5l8 blooms is best
p6l1 described as
p6l2 peppermint-apple,
p6l3 with a dash of garlic.
p6l4 'Tis a popular potted
p6l5 plant despite, or
p6l6 perhaps because of,
p6l7 its exotic nature.
p6l8 Whiteflowers
p7l1 exude a subtle
p7l2 fragrance not unlike
p7l3 that of freshly
p7l4 shaven wood mixed
p7l5 with cool lemon ice.
p7l6 Their tall stands
p7l7 always droop with the
p7l8 heavy weight of their
p8l1 massive blooms, oft as
p8l2 large as a child's head.
p8l3 The flowers are so
p8l4 large that one may
p8l5 scoop out the pollen in
p8l6 handfuls and during
p8l7 the spring season
p8l8 many a prank hath
p9l1 been played by idle
p9l2 boys 'pon their sisters
p9l3 by dumping said
p9l4 pollen into their
p9l5 clothing drawers,
p9l6 causing sneezes for
p9l7 days.
p9l8 The most
p10l1 interesting native tree
p10l2 to Britannia is the
p10l3 spider tree. The
p10l4 reason for its naming
p10l5 is obscure, but may
p10l6 have to do with the
p10l7 twisted gray stalks
p10l8 from which the
p11l1 spherical canopy
p11l2 sprouts. 'Tis
p11l3 something of a
p11l4 misnomer to term
p11l5 these trunks as they
p11l6 are spindly and
p11l7 flexible. Spider trees
p11l8 provide a fresh, piney
p12l1 smell to a room and are
p12l2 therefore often potted.
p12l3 In jungle climes,
p12l4 one finds the blade
p12l5 plant, whose sharp
p12l6 leaves oft collect
p12l7 water for the thirsty
p12l8 traveler, yet can draw
p13l1 blood easily.
p13l2 The deadliest plant,
p13l3 if you can call a
p13l4 fungus a plant, is the
p13l5 Exploding Red Spotted
p13l6 Toadstool. No pattern
p13l7 can be discerned to its
p13l8 habitats save malice,
p14l1 for merely
p14l2 approaching results in
p14l3 the cap exploding with
p14l4 powder, noxious gas,
p14l5 and tiny painful
p14l6 pellets flying in all
p14l7 directions.
p14l8 Unfortunately, 'tis
p15l1 impossible to tell it
p15l2 apart from the
p15l3 Ordinary Red Spotted
p15l4 Toadstool save through
p15l5 experimentation.
p15l6 Truly odd among the
p15l7 varied flora of
p15l8 Britannia, however,
p16l1 are those which bear
p16l2 names clearly alien to
p16l3 our tongue. Among
p16l4 these I name the
p16l5 Tuscany pine (for I
p16l6 have never seen a
p16l7 region of this world
p16l8 named Tuscany), the
p17l1 o'hii tree, whose very
p17l2 name sounds like some
p17l3 tropical isle and the
p17l4 welsh poppy, which
p17l5 while different from
p17l6 an ordinary poppy in
p17l7 color and appearance,
p17l8 is prefaced with the
p18l1 odd word welsh,
p18l2 which as far as I
p18l3 know means to forgo
p18l4 paying a debt.

p1l7 nonetheless for the

title The wild girl of the forest
author Horace
p1l1 Her name was
p1l2 Leyla, she said and
p1l3 her hair was braided
p1l4 wild with creepers
p1l5 and thorns. I marveled
p1l6 that they did not hurt
p1l7 her, but when I asked,
p1l8 she but shrugged and
p2l1 let her eyes roam once
p2l2 more across the
p2l3 woods. Though I had
p2l4 my hands securely
p2l5 fastened by her
p2l6 ropes, I itched to
p2l7 reach out and comb
p2l8 that unruly golden
p3l1 mane, dirtied and
p3l2 leaf-ridden.
p3l3 Her provenance,
p3l4 she told me over
p3l5 nights illuminated by
p3l6 campfires, was once
p3l7 the city of Trinsic.
p3l8 She claimed to have
p4l1 been kidnapped and
p4l2 raised by orcs, which
p4l3 I judged an unlikely
p4l4 tale, for all know orcs
p4l5 delight in eating the
p4l6 meat of honest folk.
p4l7 When I told her this,
p4l8 she laughed a fey
p5l1 laugh and gaily
p5l2 admitted that honest
p5l3 she was not, for oft
p5l4 had she stolen folk
p5l5 away from caravans
p5l6 to loot their
p5l7 possessions from an
p5l8 unconscious body!
p6l1 At this, I began to
p6l2 fear for my life and
p6l3 her smile seemed full
p6l4 of teeth sharper than
p6l5 a human ought to have,
p6l6 for the tale of orcish
p6l7 raising had struck
p6l8 fear into the marrow
p7l1 of my bones. Wil thou
p7l2 eat me? I asked,
p7l3 a-tremble, fearing
p7l4 the answer.
p7l5 And she cocked her
p7l6 head at me, like a wild
p7l7 animal facing a word
p7l8 that it dost not
p8l1 understand and the
p8l2 fixity in her eyes
p8l3 was a glimpse into the
p8l4 deeper reaches of the
p8l5 Abyss. But she
p8l6 finally grunted and
p8l7 said Nay, in a voice
p8l8 that recalled to me a
p9l1 child. Nay, she said,
p9l2 for thou dost remind
p9l3 me of a boy I knew
p9l4 once, when I was a
p9l5 girl who played in a
p9l6 city of great sandstone
p9l7 walls, before I was
p9l8 taken. He had sandy
p10l1 hair like thee and I
p10l2 dreamt as a child of
p10l3 holding his hand and
p10l4 sharing flavored ice.
p10l5 His name was
p10l6 Japheth.
p10l7 The next morning
p10l8 she let me go, stripped
p11l1 of my pouch and
p11l2 clothes and bade me
p11l3 run through the
p11l4 woods and to fear
p11l5 recapture, for surely
p11l6 her heart would not
p11l7 soften again. 'Twas a
p11l8 fearful run and I
p12l1 came to the road to
p12l2 Yew with welts and
p12l3 scratches run
p12l4 rampant crost my
p12l5 skin, but I did not see
p12l6 her again.
p12l7 Oft have I wondered
p12l8 of the boy named
p13l1 Japheth and whether
p13l2 he remembers a girl
p13l3 who lived in sandstone
p13l4 walls. The only
p13l5 Japheth I know is the
p13l6 Guildmaster of
p13l7 Paladins who died last
p13l8 year warring amidst
p14l1 the orcs and though
p14l2 he had indeed sandy
p14l3 hair, I cannot picture
p14l4 him side by side with
p14l5 a feral girl whose
p14l6 tongue has tasted of
p14l7 human flesh. Yet the
p14l8 paths of fate are
p15l1 strange indeed and I
p15l2 suppose 'tis possible
p15l3 that this paladin died
p15l4 defending his
p15l5 remembered lady's
p15l6 honor, unknowingly
p15l7 struck down by the
p15l8 orc that she called
p16l1 father.

title The tale of three tribes
author Janet
p1l1 The dungeon known
p1l2 as Despise is in fact
p1l3 not a dungeon as such,
p1l4 but rather a large
p1l5 natural cave.
p1l6 Inhospitable and
p1l7 unfriendly to visitors
p1l8 it is filled with damp
p2l1 spots where the
p2l2 deadly Exploding Red
p2l3 Spotted Toadstool
p2l4 grows in abundance.
p2l5 According to the
p2l6 oldest of historical
p2l7 texts, in days gone by
p2l8 the cave was once the
p3l1 home of three
p3l2 separate tribes who
p3l3 had come to an
p3l4 accommodation with
p3l5 each other. Oddly
p3l6 enough, the three
p3l7 tribes were of
p3l8 dragons, lizard men,
p4l1 and rat men. While
p4l2 today few except
p4l3 extremists associated
p4l4 with Lord Blackthorn
p4l5 regard these latter two
p4l6 as being intelligent
p4l7 beings, apparently
p4l8 they have indeed
p5l1 fallen from a more
p5l2 evolved state over the
p5l3 years.
p5l4 'Tis said that these
p5l5 three races did dwell
p5l6 in relative harmony
p5l7 within the vast cave,
p5l8 building when they
p6l1 required it and
p6l2 trading amongst
p6l3 themselves if needed.
p6l4 But over time,
p6l5 something happened,
p6l6 and they were forced
p6l7 to withdraw from
p6l8 their society, until
p7l1 today thou mayst find
p7l2 individuals of each
p7l3 species within the
p7l4 dungeon, but never
p7l5 again as a civilization.
p7l6 'Tis also said that
p7l7 someday the three
p7l8 tribes may return to
p8l1 Despise, to once again
p8l2 inhabit it together.
p8l3 Until then, nothing
p8l4 remains as a token of
p8l5 this save an oddly
p8l6 intelligent skeleton
p8l7 magically enchanted
p8l8 that doth speak when
p9l1 questions are asked
p9l2 and from whom I
p9l3 obtained these tales
p9l4 one day, when I was
p9l5 pursued by evil
p9l6 monsters and fled into
p9l7 his skeletal arms.
p9l8 Fortunately, I
p10l1 escaped and lived to
p10l2 write it all down!

title The burning of Trinsic
author Paladin Japheth
p1l1 'Twas a sight to see,
p1l2 the sunlight falling
p1l3 lightly on the
p1l4 sandstone walls of
p1l5 Trinsic 'pon a morning
p1l6 in spring.
p1l7 Children ran along
p1l8 the parapets and
p2l1 walkways, their
p2l2 laughter and running
p2l3 providing music to the
p2l4 daybreak, despite
p2l5 their oft-ragged
p2l6 clothing.
p2l7 The guards who
p2l8 maintained a vigilant
p3l1 outlook from atop the
p3l2 towers would smile
p3l3 indulgently as
p3l4 children slammed into
p3l5 their armored legs and
p3l6 brushed past them.
p3l7 And I was one of
p3l8 those young ones,
p4l1 letting my joy rise up
p4l2 to the skies.
p4l3 Little did we all
p4l4 know of the darker
p4l5 days that would lie
p4l6 ahead, for we were too
p4l7 young.
p4l8 Had we but gained
p5l1 access to the quiet
p5l2 coucils held in the
p5l3 Paladin tower as it
p5l4 faced the sea, councils
p5l5 lit by candlelight and
p5l6 worry, we would have
p5l7 learned more of the
p5l8 fears of imminent
p6l1 attack from the
p6l2 forest, where foul
p6l3 creatures born of
p6l4 dank caves and
p6l5 darkness were
p6l6 marauding ever more
p6l7 often into the lands
p6l8 around Trinsic's moat.
p7l1 But we were
p7l2 children! The parapets
p7l3 and the moat were
p7l4 places to play, not
p7l5 stout defenses and
p7l6 we gave no thought to
p7l7 the necessities that
p7l8 must have required
p8l1 their construction.
p8l2 We used to reach
p8l3 the sheltered
p8l4 orchards on the lee
p8l5 side of the parapet
p8l6 walls, where the
p8l7 southern river cut
p8l8 through the city, by
p9l1 swimming across the
p9l2 water.
p9l3 The rich folk who
p9l4 lived in the great
p9l5 manses there would
p9l6 shout from their
p9l7 windows and shake
p9l8 their fists, for we
p10l1 would run through
p10l2 their gardens and tear
p10l3 up the delicate
p10l4 foxgloves and
p10l5 orfleurs with our
p10l6 unshod dirty feet.
p10l7 Then we would dive
p10l8 into the water and
p11l1 splash merrily to the
p11l2 fruit trees.
p11l3 The southern river
p11l4 lazily slid under an
p11l5 ungated arch in the
p11l6 mighty wall and we
p11l7 would lay on the
p11l8 grassy bank and
p12l1 watch it gurgle by the
p12l2 lily pads.
p12l3 That spring that
p12l4 pleasant spot became
p12l5 the doorway through
p12l6 which our city of
p12l7 Trinsic let in the
p12l8 monstrous deformed
p13l1 humanoids that
p13l2 savaged us.
p13l3 I lay upon that
p13l4 grassy bank and
p13l5 watched them wade
p13l6 in, their coarse hair
p13l7 wet and matted, algae
p13l8 and muck festooning
p14l1 their wild brows.
p14l2 They caught sight of a
p14l3 quicksilver girl with
p14l4 bright blond hair and
p14l5 lively eyes. Her name
p14l6 was Leyla and that
p14l7 spring I had held fond
p14l8 dreams of holding her
p15l1 hand and sharing
p15l2 flavored ice while
p15l3 dangling our feet off
p15l4 the small bridge by
p15l5 Smugglers Gate.
p15l6 And I said nothing
p15l7 when they caught
p15l8 her and did not cry
p16l1 out when they dragged
p16l2 her off through that
p16l3 breach in our wall,
p16l4 and did not warn the
p16l5 city when I saw the
p16l6 helmeted orc captains
p16l7 call the charge upon
p16l8 the mansions.
p17l1 Blame me not, for I
p17l2 was but a child and
p17l3 one who hid in the
p17l4 branches of the peach
p17l5 trees, all a-tremble
p17l6 whilst I watched the
p17l7 smoke rise from Sean
p17l8 the tailor's and fire
p18l1 lash out at the roof of
p18l2 witchy Eleanor's
p18l3 tavern.
p18l4 To this day I have
p18l5 had no word of Leyla,
p18l6 and to this day the
p18l7 smell of burning wood
p18l8 can conjure terrible
p19l1 dreams. Yet with the
p19l2 eyes of adulthood, 'tis
p19l3 possible to examine
p19l4 the flaws in the
p19l5 defense of Trinsic on
p19l6 that fateful day and
p19l7 the reasons why our
p19l8 walls are now
p20l1 double-thick and
p20l2 why our buildings are
p20l3 now built as
p20l4 fortresses within a
p20l5 somber fortified city.
p20l6 While I can look out
p20l7 from the top of the
p20l8 new Paladin tower,
p21l1 and spy the mighty
p21l2 white sails across the
p21l3 barrier island and
p21l4 can descry the small
p21l5 hollow south of the
p21l6 city where gypsies
p21l7 are wont to camp, I can
p21l8 also envision the city
p22l1 as it might be burning,
p22l2 and I bless the bargain
p22l3 we made: space for
p22l4 safety, grace for
p22l5 sturdiness and wood
p22l6 for stone.
p22l7 Whilst I live, I shall
p22l8 not see Trinsic burn,
p23l1 and no more cries of
p23l2 little girls will haunt
p23l3 the sleep of our fair
p23l4 citizens.
p23l5 This is mine oath,
p23l6 as I live and breath.
p23l7 -Japheth, Paladin
p23l8 Guildmaster of the
p24l1 City of Trinsic.

title The Fight
author M. De La Garza
p1l1 A cold autumn
p1l2 morning with misty
p1l3 fog secures a dozen
p1l4 brave knights,
p1l5 supplying hidden
p1l6 shelter from prying
p1l7 eyes deep in the
p1l8 foothills of the
p2l1 vibrant valley.
p2l2 Dragons soar like
p2l3 fierce warriors,
p2l4 circling around and
p2l5 around, then roaring
p2l6 like thunder, rallying
p2l7 all that listen. The
p2l8 dragons land swiftly
p3l1 beside the proud
p3l2 warriors, bending
p3l3 necks and extending
p3l4 wings, lifting black
p3l5 claws and allowing
p3l6 valiant fighters to ride
p3l7 forth and win an
p3l8 arisen battle. The
p4l1 increasing winds
p4l2 silence the sounds of
p4l3 combat and they
p4l4 fight, standing their
p4l5 ground like mothers
p4l6 protecting their
p4l7 children, bright
p4l8 armor flashing as
p5l1 each one falls.
p5l2 A cold autumn's
p5l3 evening with misty
p5l4 fog cradles a dozen
p5l5 battered corpses of
p5l6 knights, creasing
p5l7 them in currents of
p5l8 winds that run deep in
p6l1 the foothills of the
p6l2 desolate valley.
p6l3 Dragons glide like
p6l4 silent angels, circling
p6l5 around and around,
p6l6 then calling like
p6l7 banshees; keening
p6l8 cries of mourning.
p7l1 The dragons land
p7l2 heavily beside the
p7l3 peaceful bodies,
p7l4 bending their necks
p7l5 and extending wings,
p7l6 lifting black claws
p7l7 and pinching the
p7l8 sacred ground and
p8l1 new eternal home.
p8l2 The dying winds
p8l3 whistle among the
p8l4 dead in somber
p8l5 procession and they
p8l6 lie, grasping weapons
p8l7 to protect themselves
p8l8 like knights still in
p9l1 battle, shattered
p9l2 armor shining like
p9l3 newly born stars.

title A primer on arms
author Martin
p1l1 ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
p1l2 Martin was, for most
p1l3 of his life, the
p1l4 Weaponsmaster of
p1l5 Serpent's Hold, until
p1l6 his death at 92, of an
p1l7 overgrown bunion.
p1l8 These are the basic
p2l1 element to consider in
p2l2 assessing a weapon of
p2l3 which all warrior
p2l4 who regard
p2l5 themselves as more
p2l6 than mere
p2l7 mercenaries should be
p2l8 aware. First and most
p3l1 obvious is the amount
p3l2 of damage that the
p3l3 weapon may do against
p3l4 unprotected flesh.
p3l5 While 'tis this that
p3l6 first attracts the
p3l7 attention of the novice
p3l8 'tis a deadly mistake
p4l1 to regard it as the
p4l2 sole value of a weapon.
p4l3 While it may prove
p4l4 devastating indeed as a
p4l5 means of causing
p4l6 damage, a weapon
p4l7 must also serve as
p4l8 stout shield when
p5l1 engaged in combat.
p5l2 Hence the second
p5l3 issue to which to pay
p5l4 attention is the amount
p5l5 of protection that a
p5l6 weapon may offer.
p5l7 Pay close attention to
p5l8 the guard on it, if it
p6l1 be a blade, or the
p6l2 stoutness of it's wood
p6l3 if it is a polearm.
p6l4 Oft related to this is
p6l5 the wait of a weapon,
p6l6 for a heavy weapon is
p6l7 more difficult to
p6l8 maneuver to block
p7l1 with, though it may do
p7l2 more damage to they
p7l3 opponent. If a weapon
p7l4 is too heavy for the
p7l5 wielder to move it
p7l6 freely, they should
p7l7 choose another and not
p7l8 attempt to prove their
p8l1 prowess by the size
p8l2 of their sword.
p8l3 The reach of the
p8l4 weapon both increase
p8l5 its defensive ability,
p8l6 and renders it more
p8l7 useful in open spaces
p8l8 as it allows attack
p9l1 against the opponent
p9l2 without the need to
p9l3 close. But be aware of
p9l4 the limitations of thy
p9l5 weapon! For a weapon
p9l6 with great reach may
p9l7 be useless in close
p9l8 quarter, for lack of
p10l1 space to maneuver it.
p10l2 Should that
p10l3 dagger-wielding
p10l4 enemy close on thee
p10l5 and they halberd, 'tis
p10l6 best to flee.
p10l7 Lastly, a factor that
p10l8 must always be
p11l1 considered is the
p11l2 condition of the
p11l3 weapon. It might be a
p11l4 wondrous magical
p11l5 blade of surpassing
p11l6 sharpness and it may
p11l7 leap to block blows
p11l8 with a mind of its
p12l1 own. It also might be
p12l2 of such flimsy
p12l3 construction, or
p12l4 damaged to such an
p12l5 extent, that the first
p12l6 time it clangs against
p12l7 steel, 'twill shatter
p12l8 into useless shards.
p13l1 Seek ye a good
p13l2 blacksmith should
p13l3 they weapon become
p13l4 damaged, but be aware
p13l5 that their
p13l6 ministrations may
p13l7 simply make the
p13l8 matter worse.
p14l1 While mages of
p14l2 some ability oft create
p14l3 magical weapons
p14l4 which enhance skill,
p14l5 are preternaturally
p14l6 sharp, or incinerate
p14l7 the enemy as they
p14l8 fall, to mind the
p15l1 greatest gift that they
p15l2 can grant a stout
p15l3 sword is to make it
p15l4 resistant to damage,
p15l5 for they own skill can
p15l6 make up the
p15l7 difference. Except
p15l8 for the fireball, but
p16l1 if the corpse is
p16l2 charred, then so will
p16l3 be the possessions,
p16l4 which maketh looting
p16l5 difficult!

title Deceit: A dungeon of horrors
author Mercenary Justin
p1l1 My employers have
p1l2 oft taken me into this
p1l3 den of hideous
p1l4 creatures and I
p1l5 thought that it
p1l6 behooved me to write
p1l7 down what I know of
p1l8 it, now that I am
p2l1 retired from the life
p2l2 of an adventurer for
p2l3 hire.
p2l4 Deceit was once a
p2l5 temple to forgotten
p2l6 powers of old. It was
p2l7 taken over by mages
p2l8 who eventually were
p3l1 driven out by the
p3l2 depredations of their
p3l3 own evil lackeys.
p3l4 However, many of the
p3l5 magical traps and
p3l6 devices that they
p3l7 placed for their
p3l8 defenses remain,
p4l1 particularly those the
p4l2 wizards used to
p4l3 protect their
p4l4 treasures.
p4l5 The dungeon is
p4l6 mystically linked by
p4l7 crystal balls placed in
p4l8 different locations.
p5l1 These magical orbs do
p5l2 transmit speech and
p5l3 even have memory of
p5l4 things that have been
p5l5 said near them. No
p5l6 doubt they once served
p5l7 as a warning system.
p5l8 Be wary of a
p6l1 brazier that giveth
p6l2 warning when
p6l3 approached: thou canst
p6l4 use it to summon
p6l5 deadly creatures.
p6l6 There be a
p6l7 tantalizing chest,
p6l8 undoubtedly full of
p7l1 treasure, that cannot
p7l2 be reached save past a
p7l3 complex series of
p7l4 pressure plates that
p7l5 trigger deadly spikes.
p7l6 As I never had
p7l7 sufficient folk with
p7l8 me to unlock the
p8l1 puzzle, I never
p8l2 obtained the riches
p8l3 that awaited there.
p8l4 Do not investigate
p8l5 the iron maidens too
p8l6 closely, for they make
p8l7 suck you within them!
p8l8 There is one place
p9l1 where a deadly trap
p9l2 can only be disarmed
p9l3 by making use of a
p9l4 statue that cleverly
p9l5 conceals a lever.
p9l6 Oft one encounters
p9l7 the deadly exploding
p9l8 toadstool; the ones in
p10l1 Deceit are deadlier
p10l2 than most, as they
p10l3 explode continually.
p10l4 Likewise, the very
p10l5 pools of water and
p10l6 slime on the floor may
p10l7 poisen thee.
p10l8 The most magical
p11l1 device in the dungeon
p11l2 is a mystical bridge
p11l3 that can only be
p11l4 triggered by a lever
p11l5 embedded in the floor.
p11l6 Be wary, however,
p11l7 for the bridge thus
p11l8 created doth burst
p12l1 into flame when one
p12l2 passeth across it!

title The bold stranger
author Old Fabio the Poor
p1l1 In a time before
p1l2 time, the Gods that Be
p1l3 assembled a group of
p1l4 artisans, craftsmen
p1l5 and lore masters (for,
p1l6 yes, even in those
p1l7 days, art existed) to
p1l8 create the world of
p2l1 Sosaria. To this group,
p2l2 the gods gave a tiny
p2l3 world, Rytabul, in
p2l4 which to test their
p2l5 works, to see if they
p2l6 were of the quality
p2l7 desired for the true
p2l8 world in which they
p3l1 would be placed. And
p3l2 though the gods were
p3l3 tight fisted with their
p3l4 gold, this small crew
p3l5 worked hard and long,
p3l6 and were happy in
p3l7 their tasks.
p3l8 A small corner of
p4l1 Rytabul had been
p4l2 claimed by the artisan
p4l3 Selrahc the Slow.
p4l4 Though he was not the
p4l5 fastest of the
p4l6 assembled workers,
p4l7 the gods smiled upon
p4l8 his work, even
p5l1 presenting him with a
p5l2 mystic talisman
p5l3 proclaiming his work
p5l4 the best among the
p5l5 newer artisans. And
p5l6 so Selrahc went about
p5l7 his business, creating
p5l8 hundreds of designs
p6l1 which would one day
p6l2 add color and variety
p6l3 to Sosaria.
p6l4 One day a stranger
p6l5 appeared to Selrahc.
p6l6 His chest was bare
p6l7 and he wore the
p6l8 trousers of the
p7l1 brightest green and
p7l2 wherever he went,
p7l3 plants grew in his
p7l4 footsteps. This caused
p7l5 Selrahc no end of
p7l6 trouble, the stranger
p7l7 always looking over
p7l8 his shoulder and the
p8l1 plants sprouting in
p8l2 places Selrahc
p8l3 required to ply his
p8l4 art. And so Selrahc
p8l5 approached the
p8l6 stranger and bade him
p8l7 speak. But this man in
p8l8 green remained silent.
p9l1 Selrahc pleaded with
p9l2 the stranger to give
p9l3 his name and would
p9l4 he please leave
p9l5 Selrahc to his work.
p9l6 But this mysterious
p9l7 stranger remained
p9l8 mute.
p10l1 This angered
p10l2 Selrahc mightily. Who
p10l3 was this silent man,
p10l4 interfering with
p10l5 tasks the gods
p10l6 themselves had
p10l7 entrusted to Selrahc?
p10l8 In an attempt to
p11l1 embarass this
p11l2 interloper, Selrahc
p11l3 stole his green
p11l4 trousers, leaving him
p11l5 naked and open to
p11l6 comments about his
p11l7 very manhood and
p11l8 still the stranger
p12l1 would not speak,
p12l2 would not leave this
p12l3 tiny corner of
p12l4 Rytabul.
p12l5 Vexed to his very
p12l6 limits, Selrahc took
p12l7 his war axe and smote
p12l8 the silent one
p13l1 mightily, again and
p13l2 again, until the silent
p13l3 stranger ran away,
p13l4 having never said a
p13l5 word and never
p13l6 showed himself in
p13l7 Rytabul again.
p13l8 Thus endeth the
p14l1 tale of the bold
p14l2 stranger.

title The major trade associations
author Pieter of Vesper
p1l1 There are ten major
p1l2 trade associations that
p1l3 operate legitimately in
p1l4 the lands of Britannia
p1l5 and among its trading
p1l6 partners. Many of
p1l7 these guilds are
p1l8 divided into local or
p2l1 specialty subguilds,
p2l2 who use the same
p2l3 colors but vary the
p2l4 heraldic pattern.
p2l5 There are many

title Ethical hedonism: an introduction
author Richard Garriott
p1l1 Societies oft have
p1l2 common codes of
p1l3 conduct which it
p1l4 expects all its people
p1l5 to abide by. Now, while
p1l6 'tis true that this can
p1l7 offer some
p1l8 advantages, most of
p2l1 the codes I see today
p2l2 around Britannia have
p2l3 fatal flaws. Let us
p2l4 examine them.
p2l5 First, there is
p2l6 Blackthorn's code of
p2l7 Chaos or basically
p2l8 Anarchy. Whereas
p3l1 this affords the
p3l2 individual maximum
p3l3 opportunity for
p3l4 individuality and even
p3l5 pursuit of personal
p3l6 happiness, it does not
p3l7 offer even basic
p3l8 interpersonal conduct
p4l1 codes to prevent people
p4l2 from killing each
p4l3 other.
p4l4 Without such basic
p4l5 tenets, all the people
p4l6 will need to spend a
p4l7 significant portion of
p4l8 their time and effort
p5l1 towards personal
p5l2 protection and thus
p5l3 less time towards
p5l4 other more beneficial
p5l5 pursuits.
p5l6 Then there are the
p5l7 moral codes that are so
p5l8 popular today. These
p6l1 codes are built largely
p6l2 on historical tradition
p6l3 rather than current
p6l4 logic and thus are also
p6l5 antiquated. For
p6l6 example many moral
p6l7 codes we see today
p6l8 include statements
p7l1 about not eating certain
p7l2 foods that once were
p7l3 often poisonous, but
p7l4 today can be prepared
p7l5 safely.
p7l6 Many forbid
p7l7 contact between young
p7l8 people of the opposite
p8l1 gender, which can in
p8l2 fact be hazardous; but
p8l3 the codes often have
p8l4 lost the context as to
p8l5 why this is done,
p8l6 instead merely calling
p8l7 it amoral. In this day
p8l8 and age to call that a
p9l1 necessary moral
p9l2 would need a new
p9l3 reasoning. I put forth
p9l4 that tradition is not
p9l5 enough.
p9l6 Then there are Lord
p9l7 British's Virtues. It
p9l8 strikes me that while
p10l1 a system of virtues is
p10l2 wonderful as a
p10l3 touchstone to guide a
p10l4 society to good
p10l5 behavior, these are
p10l6 but shades of the
p10l7 underlying truth as to
p10l8 why one may wish to
p11l1 live a life according to
p11l2 certain rules of
p11l3 conduct.
p11l4 On the other hand,
p11l5 clearly the Virtues
p11l6 that I have heard Lord
p11l7 British speak of are
p11l8 clearly positive codes
p12l1 of conduct, far better
p12l2 than the world of
p12l3 anarchy that Lord
p12l4 Blackthorn suggests.
p12l5 Yet, are not these
p12l6 Virtues still derived
p12l7 from a set of
p12l8 principles which
p13l1 though they sound
p13l2 good, are difficult to
p13l3 pin down as actual,
p13l4 undeniable, rational
p13l5 truths?,
p13l6 Worse yet though
p13l7 imagine a society
p13l8 who's code of conduct
p14l1 was based on pure
p14l2 survival of the
p14l3 strongest. While this
p14l4 society may function
p14l5 and even accomplish
p14l6 much, it can be fairly
p14l7 argued that personal
p14l8 happiness would
p15l1 suffer greatly except
p15l2 for those at the top. To
p15l3 rule that out,
p15l4 however, we must
p15l5 first believe that
p15l6 people have a right to
p15l7 pursue happiness.
p15l8 I hope is a safe
p16l1 assumption that all
p16l2 beings wish to be
p16l3 happy; I will broadly
p16l4 describe this as
p16l5 Hedonism. Yet, if all
p16l6 people did is live a life
p16l7 of hedonism, their
p16l8 hedonism might be in
p17l1 conflict with those
p17l2 near them, so I will
p17l3 use the term Ethics to
p17l4 describe limits one
p17l5 might put on one's
p17l6 hedonistic tendencies
p17l7 to allow others to
p17l8 pursue their
p18l1 happiness as well.
p18l2 Allow me to give
p18l3 this example: If one
p18l4 were to live alone on a
p18l5 desert isle, one could
p18l6 live a life of pure
p18l7 hedonism, for no
p18l8 action one might take
p19l1 could interfere with
p19l2 another's right to
p19l3 pursue their
p19l4 happiness. Poison the
p19l5 lake if you like, there
p19l6 is no one to blame but
p19l7 yourself!
p19l8 Now suppose two of
p20l1 you live on that island.
p20l2 Thou dost not want
p20l3 thy neighbor to feel
p20l4 free to poison the lake.
p20l5 Would it not be better
p20l6 to consider it unethical
p20l7 to poison the lake
p20l8 without first thinking
p21l1 of those whose
p21l2 pursuit of happiness
p21l3 might be affected by
p21l4 this action?,
p21l5 I put forth that it is
p21l6 the fact that we as a
p21l7 people choose to live in
p21l8 groups known as a
p22l1 society that causes us
p22l2 to compromise our
p22l3 pure hedonism with
p2l4 logical ethics.
p22l5 Likewise we accept not
p22l6 being able to kill
p22l7 others without reason,
p22l8 because our own
p23l1 pursuit of happiness
p23l2 would be greatly
p23l3 interfered with if we
p23l4 feared others would
p23l5 do the same to us.
p23l6 From this basis of
p23l7 logic can be formed
p23l8 the Tenets of Ethical
p24l1 Hedonism.
p24l2 For more on this
p24l3 subject, see the
p24l4 Tenants of Ethical
p24l5 Hedonism, by Richard
p24l6 Garriott and Herman
p24l7 Miller.

title The life of the traveling ministrel
author Sarah of Yew
p1l1 While 'tis true that
p1l2 the musician who
p1l3 seeketh only to make
p1l4 sweet music for
p1l5 herself and for
p1l6 others needs little
p1l7 more than some talent,
p1l8 and stern practice at
p2l1 the chosen instrument
p2l2 those of us who seek
p2l3 the open road shall
p2l4 find indeed that a
p2l5 greater skill is
p2l6 required. Herein
p2l7 discover those secrets
p2l8 which I have learned
p3l1 over the years as an
p3l2 itinerant performer.
p3l3 Once I was in
p3l4 Jhelom and accidently
p3l5 angered the bravo of
p3l6 some local repute,
p3l7 whose blade flickered
p3l8 all too eagerly near
p4l1 my slender neck (for I
p4l2 was young then).
p4l3 After various threats
p4l4 to ruin my pretty
p4l5 face this bravo
p4l6 grabbed my arm in a
p4l7 most unseemly
p4l8 fashion and tossed me
p5l1 into a barbaric
p5l2 enclosure locally
p5l3 entitled a dueling pit.
p5l4 My plaintive cries for
p5l5 help went unheeded
p5l6 by the guards, for the
p5l7 inhabitants of Jhelom
p5l8 are eager indeed to
p6l1 measure fighting
p6l2 prowess at any time!
p6l3 What saved me was
p6l4 the ability to
p6l5 improvise a melody
p6l6 and tune that satirized
p6l7 the proceedings and
p6l8 sufficiently angered
p7l1 an onlooker to prod
p7l2 him to coming to my
p7l3 defense. Once that
p7l4 fight was underway I
p7l5 was able to make good
p7l6 my escape. Hence, I
p7l7 regard the ability to
p7l8 incite fights as
p8l1 indispensable to the
p8l2 prudent bard.
p8l3 Upon another
p8l4 occasion, 'twas the
p8l5 obverse side of that
p8l6 coin which saved me
p8l7 for I was being held
p8l8 prisoner by a
p9l1 particularly nasty
p9l2 band of ruffians who
p9l3 had seized me
p9l4 unawares from the
p9l5 road to Vesper.
p9l6 They had worked
p9l7 themselves into a
p9l8 frenzy and were
p10l1 ready to attack and I
p10l2 fear, tear me limb
p10l3 from limb, when I
p10l4 began to sing
p10l5 frantically, tapping
p10l6 my fallen drum wit
p10l7 my tied up feet. The
p10l8 melody developed into
p11l1 a soothing one and the
p11l2 brigands slowly
p11l3 calmed down to the
p11l4 extent of apologizing,
p11l5 and they let me go!
p11l6 A final example I
p11l7 would pray you grant
p11l8 your attention: once I
p12l1 was lost upon a large
p12l2 isle far to the east of
p12l3 the mainland, well
p12l4 beyond Serpent's Hold,
p12l5 where lava made its
p12l6 sluggish way across
p12l7 the surface landscape.
p12l8 And this accursed
p13l1 land was filled with
p13l2 vile beats and cunning
p13l3 dragons.
p13l4 I was being pursued
p13l5 by one of said fell
p13l6 dragons when I found
p13l7 myself trapped. I
p13l8 quickly skirted a
p14l1 bubbling pool of molten
p14l2 rock and attempted to
p14l3 hide. The dragon
p14l4 scented me and was
p14l5 preparing to skirt the
p14l6 pool, when I began to
p14l7 play a lusty tune upon
p14l8 my lute that attracted
p15l1 its attention.
p15l2 Mesmerized and
p15l3 enticed by the melody,
p15l4 it stepped directly
p15l5 towards me and into
p15l6 the lava-where its
p15l7 foot was so burned
p15l8 that it quickly hopped
p16l1 away, undignified and
p16l2 annoyed.
p16l3 'Tis my fond hope
p16l4 that other travelling
p16l5 minstrels shall learn
p16l6 from my experience
p16l7 and apply themselves
p16l8 to practicing these
p17l1 skills in order to
p17l2 preserve life and
p17l3 limb.

title My book
author Sherry the mouse
p1l1 'Twas on a chill
p1l2 night, when the moon
p1l3 shone pasty-faced
p1l4 above the horizon,
p1l5 balanced on the towers
p1l6 of Lord British's
p1l7 castle, that the events
p1l8 I am about to relate
p2l1 tookplace, some years
p2l2 ago now. I witnessed
p2l3 them all from my tiny
p2l4 mousehole.
p2l5 Milords British and
p2l6 Blackthron are
p2l7 accustomed to a game
p2l8 of chess 'pon an
p3l1 evening, over which
p3l2 they argue the issues
p3l3 that affect the course
p3l4 of the realm. Lord
p3l5 Blackthorn was on his
p3l6 way to Lord British's
p3l7 chambers and Lord
p3l8 British stood by a
p4l1 window casement,
p4l2 just having finished
p4l3 setting the pieces upon
p4l4 the board.
p4l5 Suddenly the
p4l6 shutters blew open,
p4l7 and Lord British fell
p4l8 to the ground, one
p5l1 hand shileding his
p5l2 eyes. A chill wind
p5l3 entered the room and
p5l4 it seemd a gash was
p5l5 torn in the very air.
p5l6 Through the gas I
p5l7 could see stars and
p5l8 swirling clouds of
p6l1 stellar dust and a
p6l2 coldness sucked all
p6l3 the warmth from the
p6l4 air. A terrible wind
p6l5 tossed books and
p6l6 blankets across the
p6l7 room and furniture
p6l8 toppled.
p7l1 From within this
p7l2 gash issued a great
p7l3 voice, unlike any I
p7l4 have ever heard. And
p7l5 these are the words it
p7l6 spoke (for I
p7l7 memorized them most
p7l8 carefully):,
p8l1 Greetings, Lord
p8l2 British. I am the Time
p8l3 Lord, a being from
p8l4 beyond your
p8l5 dimension, as thou art
p8l6 from a world other
p8l7 than Sosaria. I am
p8l8 here to bring thee
p9l1 warning. Dost thou
p9l2 recall how long ago
p9l3 mysterious Stranger
p9l4 came to Sosaria and
p9l5 saved the world from
p9l6 the evil wizard
p9l7 Mondain? He shattered
p9l8 the Gem of Immortality,
p10l1 within which dwelled a
p10l2 perfect likeness of
p10l3 this world.
p10l4 Lord British slowly
p10l5 stood and faced the
p10l6 hole in the air. I
p10l7 remember, he said.
p10l8 Oft have I wished
p11l1 that stranger would
p11l2 return.
p11l3 He hath returned,
p11l4 spoke the voice. But
p11l5 not to here. When the
p11l6 Gem was shattered, a
p11l7 thousand shards were
p11l8 scattered across the
p12l1 dimensions and in
p12l2 each shard there is a
p12l3 perfect likeness of
p12l4 this world. And thou
p12l5 dost live upon one
p12l6 such shard, for thou
p12l7 art not of the true
p12l8 world-thou art
p13l1 merely a reflection.
p13l2 Lord British looked
p13l3 shaken by this and I
p13l4 did not know what to
p13l5 think! Was I merely a
p13l6 shadow of the real
p13l7 me, which lives still
p13l8 somewhere else
p14l1 across uncounted
p14l2 universes?,
p14l3 My task is to heal
p14l4 this shattered world,
p14l5 Lord British, said the
p14l6 voice. And I seek to
p14l7 enlist thee in my
p14l8 cause. Be warned that
p15l1 in this case, healing
p15l2 carries with it a
p15l3 terrible price.
p15l4 Concern warred
p15l5 with curiosity on my
p15l6 liege's face, but ever
p15l7 one to shoulder a
p15l8 burden, he
p16l1 straightened and faced
p16l2 the gash in the air
p16l3 bravely. Name thy
p16l4 price.
p16l5 A shard of a
p16l6 universe is a
p16l7 powerful thing and
p16l8 universe shattered is
p17l1 always in danger
p17l2 from the powers of
p17l3 darkness. Already
p17l4 three shards were
p17l5 turned to evil and sent
p17l6 to plague the original
p17l7 universe in the form
p17l8 of Shadowlords.
p18l1 Many times have I
p18l2 brought the Stranger
p18l3 back to Britannia, to
p18l4 preserve it from its
p18l5 own folly or from
p18l6 outside dangers. Yet
p18l7 as long as the world
p18l8 remaineth in pieces, it
p19l1 remaineth vulnerable.
p19l2 We must bring the
p19l3 shards into harmony,
p19l4 so that they resonate
p19l5 in such a manner that
p19l6 matches the original
p19l7 universe. Then the
p19l8 two universes shall
p20l1 merge and be again as
p20l2 one.
p20l3 But if we are only
p20l4 shadows... Lord
p20l5 British said
p20l6 wonderingly.
p20l7 The light from the
p20l8 stars within the hole
p21l1 seemed to dim.
p21l2 Indeed, the
p21l3 reflections shall
p21l4 become one with the
p21l5 orginal. Thou wouldst
p21l6 cease to be as thou art
p21l7 and become part of the
p21l8 larger you. Thou shalt
p22l1 not die; however,
p22l2 uncounted generations
p22l3 have passed and borne
p22l4 children since that
p22l5 day and they have no
p22l6 counterparts. They
p22l7 would perish utterly.
p22l8 Lord British sagged in
p23l1 shock, realizing the
p23l2 terrible price that
p23l3 would be paid to heal
p23l4 the universe. All of
p23l5 my people, he
p23l6 breathed.
p23l7 Tis for the
p23l8 greateer good.
p24l1 Lord British bowed
p24l2 his head.
p24l3 'Twas then I saw
p24l4 the movement by the
p24l5 door, half-hid by the
p24l6 heavy red curtains.
p24l7 Lord Blackthron stood
p24l8 there, concealed from
p25l1 the rest of the room,
p25l2 his face white. How
p25l3 long had he been
p25l4 listening? I cannot
p25l5 say, yet I suspect that
p25l6 he had heard all that
p25l7 the mysterious voice
p25l8 had to say.
p26l1 How then, shall I
p26l2 aid thee? Lord
p26l3 British said,
p26l4 weariness in his
p26l5 voice.
p26l6 Aid the nobility
p26l7 that resideth in
p26l8 human heart. Protect
p27l1 the Virtues that so
p27l2 recently came to thee
p27l3 in thought late at
p27l4 night. They are the
p27l5 Virtues of life, as
p27l6 your counterpart
p27l7 understands them to
p27l8 be. For when thy
p28l1 populace doth live and
p28l2 breathe these Virtues
p28l3 shall it match the true
p28l4 Britannia and thy
p28l5 shard shall rejoin
p28l6 with it.
p28l7 The gash in the air
p28l8 began to close and
p29l1 with it warmth stole
p29l2 back into the room.
p29l3 I was going to
p29l4 discuss my idea with
p29l5 Blackthorn tonight,
p29l6 Lord British breathed.
p29l7 Have I no thoughts
p29l8 that are my own? Is
p30l1 my life but a
p30l2 reflection of another
p30l3 me.........

title Regarding llamas
author Simon Sanmartine
p1l1 Llamas are curious
p1l2 beasts, shaggy and
p1l3 sought after for their
p1l4 wool, yet of a
p1l5 curiously arrogant
p1l6 disposition reflected
p1l7 in their eyes. They

p2l5 'Tis a well-known
p2l6 fact that llamas can
p2l7 indeed be tamed and
p2l8 used as grazing
p3l1 animals, for their
p3l2 meat and of course

p3l4 lesser known that
p3l5 their ornery

title Birds of Britannia
author Thoma th' Heather
p1l1 The WREN is a tiny
p1l2 insect-eating bird
p1l3 with a loud voice. The
p1l4 cheerful trills of
p1l5 Wrens are
p1l6 extraordinarily varied
p1l7 and melodious.
p1l8 The SWALLOW is
p2l1 easily recognized by
p2l2 its forked tail.
p2l3 Swallows catch
p2l4 insects in flight and
p2l5 have squeaky,
p2l6 twittering songs.
p2l7 The WARBLER is an
p2l8 exceptional singer,
p3l1 whose extensive
p3l2 songs combine the best
p3l3 qualities of Wrens and
p3l4 Swallows.
p3l5 The NUTHATCH
p3l6 climbs down trees
p3l7 headfirst, searching
p3l8 for insects in the
p4l1 bark. It sings a
p4l2 repetitive series of

title Taming Dragons
author Wyrd Beastmaster
p1l1 I have not much to
p1l2 tell about dragons. The
p1l3 sole time I approached
p1l4 one with an eye
p1l5 towards taming it, my
p1l6 initial attempts at
p1l7 calming it met with
p1l8 failure. It fixed a
p2l1 massive beady eye
p2l2 upon me and began its
p2l3 slithering approach,
p2l4 intending no doubt to
p2l5 insert me into its maw
p2l6 and bear down with
p2l7 its teeth.
p2l8 However, as I was
p3l1 engaged in what
p3l2 remains to this day
p3l3 the most terrifying
p3l4 combat of my life, the
p3l5 dragon suddenly
p3l6 whirled as if in a
p3l7 panic, ran a short
p3l8 distance, took off into
p4l1 the air, then
p4l2 transformed into a
p4l3 whirlwind. Lastly, it
p4l4 exploded, showering
p4l5 gouts of black blood
p4l6 and heaving, stinking
p4l7 flesh upon miles of
p4l8 countryside. The
p5l1 fireball was massive
p5l2 enough to light a city I
p5l3 should surmise.
p5l4 I never did discover
p5l5 the exact cause of this
p5l6 strange behavior
p5l7 except to assume that
p5l8 it was not typical for
p6l1 this reptilian species.
p6l2 My best guesses
p6l3 revolve around a
p6l4 magical fracture in
p6l5 the nature of reality,
p6l6 which is far too
p6l7 esoteric a territory
p6l8 for one of my limited
p7l1 scholarship.
p7l2 Hence my basic
p7l3 advice to those who
p7l4 seek to tame a
p7l5 dragon-be sure that
p7l6 thou hast mastered
p7l7 the twin skills of
p7l8 taming animals and
p8l1 running away very
p8l2 fast.

title A grammar of orcish
author Yorick of Yew
p1l1 This volume and
p1l2 others in the series,
p1l3 are sponsored by
p1l4 donations from Lord
p1l5 Blackthorn, ever a
p1l6 supporter of
p1l7 understanding the
p1l8 other sentient races of
p2l1 Britannia. -The Orcish
p2l2 tongue may fall
p2l3 unpleasingly 'pon the
p2l4 ear, yet it has
p2l5 within it a complex
p2l6 grammar oft
p2l7 misunderstood by
p2l8 those who merely
p3l1 hear the few broken
p3l2 words of English our
p3l3 orcish brothers
p3l4 manage without
p3l5 education.
p3l6 These are the basic
p3l7 rules of orcish:,
p3l8 Orcish has five
p4l1 tenses: present, past,
p4l2 future imperfect,
p4l3 present interjectional,
p4l4 and prehensile.
p4l5 Examples: gugroflu,
p4l6 gugrofloog, gugrobo,
p4l7 gugrolu! gugrogug.
p4l8 All transitive verbs in
p5l1 the prehensile tense
p5l2 end it ug.
p5l3 Examples: urgleighug,
p5l4 biggugdaghgug,
p5l5 curdakalmug.
p5l6 All present
p5l7 interjectional
p5l8 conjugations start
p6l1 with the letter G
p6l2 unless they contain
p6l3 the third declensive
p6l4 accent of the letter U.
p6l5 Examples:
p6l6 ghothudunglug, but n
p6l7 azhbuugub.
p6l8 The past tense can
p7l1 only refer to events
p7l2 since the last meal,
p7l3 but the prehensile
p7l4 tense can refer to any
p7l5 event within reach.
p7l6 The present tense is
p7l7 conjugated like the
p7l8 future imperfect
p8l1 tense, when the
p8l2 interrogative mode is
p8l3 used by pitching the
p8l4 sound a quarter-tone
p8l5 higher.
p8l6 Orcish hath no concept
p8l7 of person, as in first
p8l8 person, third person,
p9l1 I, we, etc.
p9l2 Orcish grammar
p9l3 relies upon the three
p9l4 cardinal rules of
p9l5 accretion, prefixing,
p9l6 and agglutination, in
p9l7 addition to pitch. In the
p9l8 former, phonemes
p10l1 combine into larger
p10l2 words which may
p10l3 contain full phrasal
p10l4 significance. In the
p10l5 second, prefixing
p10l6 specific phonetic
p10l7 sounds changes the
p10l8 subject of the
p11l1 sentence into object,
p11l2 interrogative,
p11l3 addressed individual,
p11l4 or dinner.
p11l5 Agglutination occurs
p11l6 whenever four of the
p11l7 same letter are
p11l8 present in a word, in
p12l1 which case, any two
p12l2 of them may be
p12l3 removed or slurred.
p12l4 Pitch changes the
p12l5 phoneme value of
p12l6 individual syllables,
p12l7 thus completely
p12l8 altering what a word
p13l1 may mean. The
p13l2 classic example if
p13l3 Aktgluthugrot
p13l4 bigglogubuu
p13l5 dargilgaglug
p13l6 lublublub which can
p13l7 mean You are such a
p13l8 pretty girl, My
p14l1 mother ate your
p14l2 primroses, or
p14l3 Jellyfish nose paints
p14l4 alms potato, depending
p14l5 on pitch.
p14l6 Orcish poetry often
p14l7 relies upon repeating
p14l8 the same phrase in
p15l1 multiple pitches, even
p15l2 changing pitch
p15l3 midword. None of
p15l4 this great are is
p15l5 translatable.
p15l6 The orcish language
p15l7 uses the following
p15l8 vowels: ab, ad, ag, akt,
p16l1 at, augh, auh, azh, e,
p16l2 i, o, oo, u, uu. The
p16l3 vowel sound a is not
p16l4 recognized as a vowel
p16l5 and does not exist in
p16l6 their alphabet. The
p16l7 orcish alphabet is best
p16l8 learned using the
p17l1 classic rhyme
p17l2 repeated at 23
p17l3 different pitchs:
p17l4 Lugnog ghu blat
p17l5 suggaroglug. Gaghbuu
p17l6 dakdar ab highugbo,
p17l7 Gothnogbuim ad
p17l8 gilgubbugbuilug
p18l1 Bilgeaugh thurggulg
p18l2 stuiggro!
p18l3 A translation of the
p18l4 first pitch:
p18l5 Eat food, the first
p18l6 letter is ab,
p18l7 Kill people, the next
p18l8 letter is ad
p19l1 I forget the rest But
p19l2 augh is in there
p19l3 somewhere!
p19l4 What follows is a
p19l5 complete phonetic
p19l6 library of the orcish
p19l7 language: ab, ad, ag,
p19l8 akt, alm, at, augh,
p20l1 auh, azh, ba, ba, bag,
p20l2 bar, baz, bid, bilge,
p20l3 bo, bog, bog, brui, bu,

p23l3 orcish language is
p23l4 not present in this
p23l5 tome. To find the
p23l6 remainder, please
