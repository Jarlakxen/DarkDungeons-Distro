//  name:    Send Stats Packet Hook
//  version: 1.1a
//  author:  MuadDib
//
//  Purpose:  This hooks the core 0x11 stats packet, and rewrites it for sending the char all the
//            extended stats for Age of Shadows like Pet Count, Min/Max Damage, statcap, etc. 2
//            Flags used per a CONST in order to decide which of the type to send.
//
//  Notes:    This is done only for example functionality. Pet Count, Damage Reports, etc is NOT
//            implemented into anything nor is the resists and luck. You can also change the global
//            var STATCAP to be a variable if required for special rising stat cap systems.
//
// CONST settings:
// BIT_MASK  = 0x00000003 DO NOT CHANGE!
//
// Global Variables:
// STATCAP = Set this to your shard's Stat Cap. If based on age, race, etc, just add a function
//           at the beginning of the exported function to check and set the statcap variable.
//           Otherwise use the new UOClient.cfg statcap entry for a static amount.
// VAR_STATCAP = If your statcap is not static, set this to 1. This will require you to populate
//               the GetStatCap() function to build the statcap amount based on your customs.
// MODE = The mode of the Status Packet. Populated by the Settings Configuration file in the pkg.
//        This is used to know how to edit the packet for AOS extended stuff.
// STATLOCK = If Statelock is enabled. sends the Stat Lock feature to the client. Requires
//            another package to handle recieving the statlock packets back from client.
