TODO:
Resistance skill gain must be added in
Eval skill gain is too easy
Create brainai scripts for summoned creatures


TODO - not in magery package:
Modify sendstats packet hook to correctly send resistances for debuging
Traps set on containers are not run when opened (needs to check/run scripts in use script)
  Make sure I'm actually using the code correctly...
When teleported into a tile with a walk-on script, it might not be activated
Yukiko says timed scripts are loopy when it comes to logging off and back on
In damage:damage, ApplyDamageEx converts all damage to int when ApplyDamage says it can handle real numbers
Magic un/lock is a little weird since there are no lock levels..


Would be nice:
Poison prevents bandages from healing damage, heal spells will also not work.
Damages sometimes appear TWICE above character when hit with direct damage spell, not sure why
Spells don't do much checking for locked down objects, objects in houses, etc...
Not sure what happens if you cast a timedScript spell multiple times on OSI. "This spell is already in effect." ?
Function to test config file, calls functions for sfx and gfx and makes sure there are no errors
Command history for the command bar :)
Command search for the command bar

For my own notes, this is how OSI does curse/bless:
Curse -	Reduces a player’s maximum elemental resistances to 60% (but only when cast by another player), as well as act like Clumsy, Feeble mind and Weaken all in one.
Bless - Counteracts stats effects and does all three good stat effects


This is the list I'll use to make sure each spell works perfectly. It's hard to keep track of all of them in my brain.
