# Explanation:
# The left-hand-side "Strength", "Intelligence", and "Dexterity" are Attribute names that
# MUST be defined in attributes.cfg.
# The right-hand-side "Life", "Mana", and "Stamina" are Vital names that
# MUST be defined in vitals.cfg.
# MaxSkillID allows you to use new client skills, but setting it too high can crash older clients.
# You must define skills.cfg entries for each skillID up to MaxSkillID (default 51).
# The Protocol and Listener sections are optional.
# Each Listener section allows you to listen for different client encryption types on different ports.
# This means you can listen for "1.26.4" clients on port 5003 and "ignition" clients on port 5555.
# Valid encryption types are found in the pol.cfg section. If you use Listeners set ListenPort
# in pol.cfg to 0.
