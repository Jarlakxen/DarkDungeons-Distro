/*
 * TS_CurePoisons()
 *
 * Purpose
 * Will take in a cure amount and try to cure / lower the duration
 * of poisons running on a mobile.
 *
 * Parameters
 * mobile:	Mobile to cure the poisons on.
 * cure_amount:	Number of duration-lowering points.
 * cure_type:	Cures poisons (timers) of that type. (Note: Most are "P" for poison)
 * level:	Level of the cure.
 *		Examples:
 *		A level 2 cure is twice as effective against a level 1 poison.
 *		It will be half as effective against a level 4 poison.
 *
 * Return value
 * Returns 1 if any curing took place
 * Returns 0 if no curing took place
