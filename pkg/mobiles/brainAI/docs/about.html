		<p>This text is included with Brain 5 for historical reference. Please note 
		that the contents are mostly valid, however they were written for Brain 
		4.x and its previous versions. The below text is pasted from the above 
		URL on the <a href="http://www.polserver.com">http://www.polserver.com</a> forums.</p>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.polserver.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=508">text</a>,
		made by Birdy, explains in an easy way what the brain is about and what the ideas behind it are.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>There is no real documentation outside of the package itself. However, 
		the package itself, in the code, is pretty well documented. So it 
		shouldn't be that hard to figure out what exactly is going on.</p>
		<p>The AI_Brain package is basically a package 
		that uses dictionaries for it's database of scripts, and messages to know 
		which ones to call and to receive instruction from those scripts.</p>
		<p>At it's heart, the brain.src script is your one true &quot;npc script&quot;.
		It includes an include which includes npc.em, and it is the script which does all direct
		communication with the npc reference. It is also generic enough that you should really
		never have to touch it for the  most part. It basically receives events from the npc
		object and uses those to determine which scripts it will start off. Those scripts are
		started, and the events appropriate to that script are passed along to it by the brain. 
		That script operates more or less independently, having received initially a 
		structure with the npc reference in it, and the event that started it off. 
		If you process events within that script, you will receive the events that 
		the brain is forwarding along to your script. In order to &quot;command&quot; the npc 
		to do things, your script usually includes npc_commands.inc. This is a set 
		of functions which basically packages up an event for each type of standard 
		npc.em function, and sends an event for each one off to the brain. The brain 
		processes these events, and executes the appropriate npc.em functionality.</p>
		<p>That is a basic understanding of what it is 
		all about, and if you look at brain.src and the various include files when 
		appropriate, you should be able to see all of this taking place and put it 
		all together as to exactly how it is happening. The brain package is a 
		little less efficient than typical AI, and it can also run into problems if 
		the event queue's get clogged with messages. But it's true glory is in it's 
		generic encapsulation. With it, you can have a bunch of npc's that are very 
		similar except, perhaps, use different combat scripts, and all you have to 
		do is write the individual combat scripts, rather than having to re-write an 
		entirely new AI script. The old AI scripts could be approached similarly 
		once you understood the various nested includes, but they were far more 
		convoluted and difficult to follow than the brain's method. But also keep in 
		mind that seperate scripts offers the flexibility(and complexity) of doing 
		things relatively independently of having to worry about the main AI. So, 
		for instance, the brain will send combat events to the combat script, and 
		that is what will keep your npc fighting, following, etc, but it will still 
		also send speech events to the listen script. So your npc can be fighting, 
		and talking, at the same time, without having to include &quot;talking logic&quot; 
		within the combat code. With the standard AI, you would either have an NPC 
		that didn't speak while fighting, or one that had to have that code imbedded 
		not only in the main AI loop, but also the combat loop. With the brain AI, 
		the brain fires off events to the appropriate scripts, starting off the 
		scripts if necessary, and those scripts run independantly of one 
		another(unless you make them rely on each other for some reason, or in some 
		manner).</p>
		<p>While adding some overhead to AI in it's pre-processing of events and multiple
		scripts to handle them, the brain package does provide quite a bit of easy flexibility
		to make your npc a little easier to manage.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>brainAI is an &quot;AI system&quot; that is very different architecturally from 
		the current distro AI. So far as I understand, it is the only other 
		released AI system for POL, although undoubtably other people have 
		written their own from ground up and just not released them.</p>
		<p>It attempts, and often succeeds, at taking the highly convoluted and 
		complex task of operating your NPC's and makes that task into a fairly 
		modular approach. In doing so, it makes alot of things much easier and 
		even simply doable.</p>
		<p>You really have to probably pick it up for yourself however and try it out.
		It can work fine right along side of the distro AI, so you can just create a new NPC
		in npcdesc.cfg which uses the brainAI to control it. So give it a try is the best advice.</p>
